# FMAN20
Home assignments from FMAN20 - Image Analysis  course, LTH https://kurser.lth.se/kursplaner/21_22%20eng/FMAN20.html 


It includes the home assignments from FMAN20 and also an OCR project. 

The framework for the project was given,  but the segmentation part (im2segment),  the extraction of features (segment2features), 
and the algorithm for classification (class_train and features2class) were coded by me. The classification algorithm uses KNN.
